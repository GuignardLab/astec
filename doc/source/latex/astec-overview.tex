\chapter{Overview}

\texttt{ASTEC}, for Adaptive Segmentation and Tracking of Embryonic Cells, was first developed during L. Guignard PhD thesis \cite{guignard:tel-01278725}. Its development has been pursued, and it was used to process 3D+t movies acquired by the MuViSPIM light-sheet microscope \cite{guignard:hal-02903409}.

It consists in several steps.

\begin{enumerate}
